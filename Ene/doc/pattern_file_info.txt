Information about the pattern file patterns.txt

Each line of this file contains a patterns and the corresponding response of the format:
"<pattern> -> <response>"
where pattern is the pattern and response is the corresponding response.

For example, take a look at the following:
"\bhate\b -> Hate is not a good thing..."
In here, "\bhate\b" and "Hate is not a good thing..." is the corresponding response

IMPORTANT: Do not forget the spaces before and after "->"

Pattern format
\b: word boundary (a character tht ends a word)
\s: white space (space, newline, etc)
%<an alphabetic character>%: string placeholder (e.g. %X%)

For example:
In "\bhate\b" this means a word boundary, followed by the string "hate", followed by another word boundary
In "\bI\slove\s%X%\b", "%X%" is a placeholder.

IMPORTANT: Do not use regular expressions (\b, \s, etc.) on responses. Only use these in the patterns.
